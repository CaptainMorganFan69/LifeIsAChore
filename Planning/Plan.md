# Life is A Chore (name to be reviewed) Overall Structure and Ideas Plan



#### <u>Mission Statement</u>

Combat depression, anxiety, and other depression-adjacent disorders and symptoms by creating a routine to take care of oneself, and/or one's household.

#### <u>Requirements:</u>

Don't cause anxiety

* No deadlines
* No punishment for missing stuff
* No "real" grinding (yes to 'progression', no to grinding)

Don't Punish

* Only positive feedback, no negative
* Never punish for missing anything
* Don't punish for not progressing quickly
  * This includes not making the grinding system too hard as previously mentioned
  * No 'unlocks' that unlock gameplay
* Allow users to reward themselves if needed, don't punish them for cheating, but still allow them to revert the results of their cheating if they want to admit their wrongdoings

Don't be boring

* Add in as much randomization and random features as possible without compromising some degree of gameplay (and without compromising any routine!)
* Don't be afraid to make crazy shit, even if it's not "business professional." This is not an app for businesses, it's for people. Memes are allowed. Jokes are allowed.
* Try new things
* Add in any good habits you can think of!

Don't enforce bad habits

* Don't reward players for 'performing poorly' even if we don't punish them
  * i.e. stop increasing cleaning rewards after 2 weeks, so as to not encourage going more than 2 weeks without cleaning

Other:

* Listen to users and take feedback seriously **BUT** be confident
  * i.e. if a user suggests something utterly stupid, confidently tell yourself you will not let that influence your decision at all. 
  * Don't wokewash anything for the sake catering to a few random user's suggestions. Being depressed is awful,  and makes many of these chores difficult and unrewarding. Trying to fix that is the whole point of this app. With that being said, we absolutely cannot reward users for literally doing nothing. That's out of the question.
  * This app is for adults, children can use it, but it is targeted towards adults. 'Inappropriate' stuff for kids should be kept to a minimum, but it's not like we're trying to make this particularly young child friendly. If users say shit like "that joke is too mature for my child" then fucking ignore that user. Parents should be responsible for teaching their own kids how to do chores, and essentially performing the same functions as this app (making chores fun even if their child is depressed), on their own. Hopefully parents will target the roots of their child's depression at the source though... just saying...

#### <u>Actual Stuff Part 1 (List of Good Habits Brainstorm):</u>

**Tier 1 (definitely going to use in V1.0):**

* Grooming
  * Bathing/Showering
    * Bathing rewarded daily
    * Washing hair rewarded bi-daily with an explanation of why most users shouldn't be washing their hair every day
* Cleaning
  * Take out trash/recycling/compost
    * Slightly encourage recycling, but keep in mind that it's harder to come by recycling organizations that don't suck ass in some locations. Also recycling costs money, so some users still may not want to pay for it. *(Especially given that multi-national corporations are a much bigger source of waste than any human could ever be, and so some users may not feel the need to recycle until large organizations actually pull their  own weight.)*
  * Laundry
    * Bed clothes
    * Other 'normal' laundry
  * General cleaning
    * Bathroom
      * Toilet, shower, and sink separate?
    * Room
    * Kitchen
    * literally anything else
      * could potentially just make the user list out their own list of separate things that may need cleaning
    * Could give slight bonus points if they clean something that was just soiled
      * i.e. cleaning something after spilling something can still count for points, just to add in some extra reward and make the user feel good about doing it even though they probably feel shitty about spilling it in the first place.
* Cooking
  * Don't reward this every day, even though some people may do it every day, a lot of people don't need to do this every day, and are , in fact, too busy to do it every day. 
  * Tier 3 idea: *Could potentially reward for not eating out or for eating healthy*
    * **Potential issue:** there are many reasons, especially being very busy, that are valid to eat out or even eat less healthily
* Socializing
  * Hang out/socialize with a friend, companion, family member, etc... pretty much anyone the user knows
    * important to separate this from 'relaxing' to indicate that this is a 100% essential thing of its own nature. I.e. even users who don't relax by being around others (strong introverts) still need to do this.
  * **Potential issue:** user has no friends or people to trust at all, in which case they need to fix that issue by getting to know someone. With that being said we should at least encourage them to get to know someone even if it may be painful for them because not having a single friend (or family member to turn to) is a severe problem. So this one could maybe be a choice, i.e. : "meet new people OR contact a friend/family member"
* Adulting
  * Pay bills
    * Rent + utilities
    * Car insurance
    * Health insurance
    * Do taxes when needed
    * etc...
* Relaxing
  * hang with friends
  * do something you like
    * could be literally anything
  * take a walk
  * many other potential ideas here
  * Obviously can't give unlimited rewards for this though

**Tier 2: Definite (but maybe unnecessary?) ideas with lower priority **

* Additional Adulting
  * Take care of car
    * Regular maintenance
    * Fill up gas *before* it's critically low
    * Wash car
    * Scrape of ice/snow if/when needed
  * Take care of lawn
    * Cut grass
    * Water stuff if/when needed
    * Clear snow off sidewalk if/when needed

 **Tier 3: Possible ideas (with listed reason why we may not want to include them, but some will probably be included in V1.0)**

* Additional, additional, adulting
  * Go to doctor regularly and/or get vaccinated for stuff
    * **Issue:**  We're not catering to anti-vaxxers, but there are other reasons why encouraging doctor visits and vaccinations could potentially backfire. Additionally, not everyone may be able to afford regular and comprehensive doctor visits
  * Family-based version of the game
    * **Issue:** very big investment for probably a much smaller user-base, not sure if wanted
  * Register/ vote in election
    * **Issue:** tbh not sure if needed

* Working out
  * **Issue:** Large part of targeted user base will be 'non-workout' levels of depression, may simply want to include fun sports with friends within the 'relaxation' category rather than encourage an actual workout schedule that the user may feel bad about not completing
* Grooming
  * Skin care
    * **Issue:**As stupid as it is, some users will not want to do skin care even if it is clearly something everyone of every race, gender, and sexuality should do. If we do add skin care it should be a very small part of gameplay to combat this, but it could potentially not be added at all if it's going to make such a little impact it won't matter.
  * Makeup
    * **Issue:** Obviously, plenty of our targeted users regardless of gender expression, will probably not be using makeup since not everyone does. It could still be nice to encourage users who want to use makeup to use it though.
  * Hair care
    * **Issue:** There are so many different ways to take care of different types of hair. Could potentially get around this by letting users set up their own hair care schedules (which would include hair dresser appointments, trims, curls, pretty much anything they need. PS: this is why it's such a hard topic to handle, I don't do most of this stuff myself lol)
* Anti-Addiction (AKA an 'amount of time clean from X' reward)
  * **Issue:** probably outside the scope of this project
* House-hold based version of the game (housemates can play together)
  * **Issue:** Probably this should be a separate version of the game not catered towards depressed people, still quite a good idea though.
* Sleeping
  * **Issue:** One of the hardest ones to address fairly because their are soooooo many reasons why some people can't get to sleep at night. Everything from general depression, to being a light sleeper, to serious disorders, to busy schedules, to simply not needing as much sleep as others (some people are genetically predisposed to not need as much sleep)
