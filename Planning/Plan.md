# Life is A Chore (name to be reviewed) Overall Structure and Ideas Plan



#### <u>Mission Statement</u>

Combat depression, anxiety, and other depression-adjacent disorders and symptoms by creating a routine to take care of oneself, and/or one's household.

#### <u>Requirements:</u>

Don't cause anxiety

* No deadlines
* No punishment for missing stuff
* No "real" grinding (yes to 'progression', no to grinding)

Don't Punish

* Only positive feedback, no negative
* Never punish for missing anything
* Don't punish for not progressing quickly
  * This includes not making the grinding system too hard as previously mentioned
  * No 'unlocks' that unlock gameplay

Don't be boring

* Add in as much randomization and random features as possible without compromising some degree of gameplay (and without compromising any routine!)
* Don't be afraid to make crazy shit, even if it's not "business professional." This is not an app for businesses, it's for people. Memes are allowed. Jokes are allowed.

Don't enforce bad habits

* Don't reward players for 'performing poorly' even if we don't punish them
  * i.e. stop increasing cleaning rewards after 2 weeks, so as to not encourage going more than 2 weeks without cleaning

#### <u>Actual Stuff:</u>
